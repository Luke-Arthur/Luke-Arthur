# Luke Arthur's GitHub Profile  <img align="right" src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Luke-Arthur&show_icons=true&color=blue">

Iâ€™m Luke, a developer focused on building solid, practical software. This profile is where I share personal projects, experiments, and tools Iâ€™ve built while sharpening my skills in software engineering.

Most of my projects, summaries, and live demos are linked over at my portfolio: [lukedevhub.tech](https://www.lukedevhub.tech). This GitHub is more of a behind-the-scenes look. A mix of compsci course work, personal builds, and general coding practice.
